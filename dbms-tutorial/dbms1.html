        <h3 class="main">What is DBMS?</h3>
        <p>
        Database Management System (DBMS) is software for storing and retrieving users data while considering appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of programs that manipulate the database. The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software store and retrieve data.

       </p>
      <h3> Some key features of a DBMS include:</h3>
      <ol>
<li> Data modeling: A DBMS provides tools for creating and modifying data models, which define the structure and relationships of the data in a database.</li>
<li> Data storage and retrieval: A DBMS is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database, and can provide various methods for searching and querying the data.</li>
<li> Concurrency control: A DBMS provides mechanisms for controlling concurrent access to the database, to ensure that multiple users can access the data without conflicting with each other.</li>
<li> Data integrity and security: A DBMS provides tools for enforcing data integrity and security constraints, such as constraints on the values of data and access controls that restrict who can access the data.</li>
<li> Backup and recovery: A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering the data in the event of a system failure.</li>
<li> DBMS can be classified into two types: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and Non-Relational Database Management System (NoSQL or Non-SQL)</li>
<li> RDBMS: Data is organized in the form of tables and each table has a set of rows and columns. The data is related to each other through primary and foreign keys.</li>
<li> NoSQL: Data is organized in the form of key-value pairs, document, graph, or column-based. These are designed to handle large-scale, high-performance scenarios.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Advantages of DBMS</h3> <ul>
<li> Controls database redundancy: It can control data redundancy because it stores all the data in one single database file and that recorded data is placed in the database.</li>
<li> Data sharing: In DBMS, the authorized users of an organization can share the data among multiple users.
<li> Easily Maintenance: It can be easily maintainable due to the centralized nature of the database system.
<li> Reduce time: It reduces development time and maintenance need.</li>
<li> Backup: It provides backup and recovery subsystems which create automatic backup of data from hardware and software failures and restores the data if required.</li>
<li> multiple user interface: It provides different types of user interfaces like graphical user interfaces, application program interfaces</li></ul>
<h3>Disadvantages of DBMS</h3> <ul>
<li> Cost of Hardware and Software: It requires a high speed of data processor and large memory size to run DBMS software.</li>
<li> Size: It occupies a large space of disks and large memory to run them efficiently.</li>
<li> Complexity: Database system creates additional complexity and requirements.</li>
<li> Higher impact of failure: Failure is highly impacted the database because in most of the organization, all the data stored in a single database and if the database is damaged due to electric failure or database corruption then the data may be lost forever.</li>
</ul>
